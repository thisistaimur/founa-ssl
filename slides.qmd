## Self-supervised vs Unsurpervised Learning

# SSL and Ecological Modeling
::: {.nonincremental}
- **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):**  
  A powerful tool for learning from vast, unlabeled ecological and environmental data, which are often costly to label.
- **Goal:**  
  Enable ecological modeling that captures patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics without needing extensive labeled datasets.
:::


# Core SSL Techniques for Ecology


## Spatial Context Learning
::: {.incremental}
1. **Contrastive Learning (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo)**
   - Learns feature representations by contrasting different "views" of the same environment (@khosla2020supervised).
   - **Use Case:**  
     Contrastive SSL can build robust habitat models by learning stable features across environmental conditions (e.g., day/night, seasonal changes). Or by contrasting different habitats to learn species-specific features.
2. **Masked Image Modeling (e.g., MAE, BEiT)** (@cao2022understand)  
   - Trains models by masking and reconstructing image parts, helping capture spatial context in fragmented or degraded habitats (@pantazis2021focus).
   - **Use Case:**  
     Satellite images with random masked regions help SSL models learn habitat structures useful for Species Distribution Models (SDMs).

### Temporal Context Learning

::: {.incremental}
1. **Temporal Contrastive Learning**
   - Temporal contrastive learning uses contrastive loss on sequential video frames to create representations that capture temporal dynamics.   
   - **Use Case:**  
     Monitoring vegetation changes over time, capturing phenological shifts and habitat degradation.
2. **Video Prediction ()**
    - Predicts future frames in video sequences, useful for monitoring ecosystem dynamics.
    - **Use Case:**  
      Tracking glacier retreat, forest fires, or river dynamics.

::: {.incremental}

1. **TerraTorch** (DLR, TU Munich, IBM)  
   - Toolkit for geospatial foundation models for Earth observation, based on NASA-IBM‚Äôs Prithvi backbone model (@jorgensen2001fundamentals).  
   - Potential for adapting to ecological remote sensing for tasks like vegetation mapping.  
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch)
  
1. **EcoBERT** (University of G√∂ttingen)  
   - BERT-based model for ecological text data, enabling large-scale ecological knowledge extraction.
   - Potential for integrating with spatial data for comprehensive ecological monitoring.
[EcoBERT Paper](https://huggingface.co/ViktorDo/EcoBERT-Pretrained)
  
1. **Contrastive Learning in Kriging** (KCP)  
   - Applying contrastive learning to spatial interpolation tasks, improving predictions in sparse data regions (@li2024non).
   - Potential for enhancing species distribution models in data-sparse regions.

# Challenges and Future Directions

## Challenges
::: {.callout-important}
- **Encoding Large-Scale Data**  
  - Hyperspectral/multispectral data encoding remains a bottleneck, but new methods are emerging (@blumenstiel2024multi).  

- **Temporal Alignment**
    - Aligning temporal data sources like UAVs, satellite images, and in-situ observations remains a challenge for long-term monitoring.

- **Reconciling Spatial Scales**  
  - Data sources like UAVs, in-situ observations, and remote sensing vary significantly in spatial scale, requiring intensive alignment efforts.
